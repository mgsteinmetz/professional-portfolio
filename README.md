# Professional-Portfolio - Advanced CSS

## Description

This is my first published professional portfolio that I will be saving for future use!

Shown below is my webpage that includes a Navigation Bar and an 'About Me' section. The navigation bar has functioning links allowing for users to easily surf the page.

Shown below is the content listed inside my 'Work" section. Which is mostly filled with 'coming soon', as I have not done much development work.
Also shown is a contact section giving viewers multiple ways to reach me.

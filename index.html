            <p>
                Hello! I am currently a student at University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamps. I also do comercial, and
                residential lawn mowing for Murtha Lawn Care LLC.
                I grew up about forty minutes east of the twin cities, in the small town of Hammond, WI.
                Outside of work and the classrom I enjoy many different activities such as; hunting, fishing, watching
                sports, and playing video games.
                The process of starting my developer career is not a short one. I came out of high school thinking that
                I was going to play college football for the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. I quickly realized
                that was not the route I wanted. I went on to change my major from Environmental Engineering, to
                Physical Therapy. I tansferred schools, and enrolled at Chippewa Valley Technical College. After leaving
                CVTC I was in search of a new career path, and my older brother came to me with the idea of becoming a
                Software Engineer like him. I never thought of the tech field as being where I would land, however I
                really enjoy technology and video games so it didn't seem out of reach. After researching more about web
                developpment, and learning to use some software on my own. I realized that I actually really enjoyed
                working with the different software programs!
